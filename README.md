  in the middle of october 2021 I started one project created in one event called NLW-heat of educational institute rocketseat, the project consists in create one badge to redirect to one of your social medias using the Github API, in the course of time I finished this project and I just continued studying Javascript and another features. Consequently I was started to study react js and I decided to upgrade this project and put the repository in public mode if you want see the page <a href="https://cracha-nlw-heat-bfybpvm8b-or1x.vercel.app/" target="_blank">check this link</a>.

<h5>

</h5>
  The "AvatarConfig" is the config of your avatar, it´s your photo, name, and your biography, if you don´t wan´t use the Github API to complete this information you should delete the "GithubAPI" and put the new infos in this areas, for default this areas is empty, so you don´t need to worry about that.
